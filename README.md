# Motor Control PID Optimization

## Overview
This project simulates electric motor response under varying load conditions using PID control tuning.

## Objectives
- Minimize steady-state error
- Reduce overshoot
- Improve response time

## Tools Used
- Python
- Control systems modeling
- Data visualization

## Results
The tuned PID parameters improved system stability and reduced oscillation under dynamic loads.
